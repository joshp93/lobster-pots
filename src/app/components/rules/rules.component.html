        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Lobster Pots. A game which tests your seaworthiness and entrepreneurial flare!</p>
        <p>You have recently opened for business as a lobster catcher.
            The objective of the game is to last as many days as possible before going bankrupt!
            You earn pieces of eight by catching lobsters in your lobster pots and selling them.
            At the end of each week the rent is due! If you cannot afford to pay then the game is over!</p>
        <p>You are given {{ gameSettings.openingCash }} pieces of eight (üí∞) and {{ gameSettings.openingPots }} lobster
            pots (üè∫) to start with.
            Each day you have 3 choices to make before setting out to sea...</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Place pots onshore:</strong> You can place 1 or more pots onshore (üèñ). This is the lowest risk
                option, but lobsters caught onshore are lower quality, so have the lowest value.</li>
            <li><strong>Place pots offshore:</strong> You can place 1 or more pots offshore (üåä). This is a more risky
                option, storms will wash away your pots! However, offshore lobsters are worth more than double the price
                of onshore ones!</li>
            <li><strong>Buy or sell pots:</strong> In addition to placing lobster pots, you can also choose to buy or
                sell them. The more lobster pots you have, the more pieces of eight you can make! Selling pots gives
                guaranteed income for that day. Pots are always sold for half the current purchase value.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every day the weather forecast will predict the chance of a storm. If there is a storm in the night, all
            offshore pots are lost to the sea!</p>
        <p>In addition, each day brings new challenges on the lobster market! For example, there might be a lobster
            shortage, where lobsters are harder to catch, but worth double.</p>
        <p>At the end of each week (every {{ gameSettings.rentInterval }} days) the rent is due. {{
            gameSettings.rentValue }} pieces of eight will automatically be taken out of you income. but if you can't
            afford to pay, the game is over! Once you purchase your {{ gameSettings.rentIncreaseInterval }}th pot, you
            need to move to a bigger business
            premises and the rent will double, then triple for {{ gameSettings.rentIncreaseInterval * 2}} and so on.
            This rent will never return to the original value, even if your number of pots drops below {{
            gameSettings.rentIncreaseInterval }}! The game will also end if you don't have
            any pots left and you can't afford to buy any.</p>
